  Before we look at whats good for us to eat I'd like to promote how wonderful
  food is. It should be celebrated and enjoyed. If you can - try to enjoy food
  around the table with family and friends, celebrate as often as you can! Give
  thanks before you eat, switch of the background noise and focus on your food;
  smell it and taste it and chew it well. These things are all so important to
  help your health and digestion.

Diet is important in all aspects of cancer management, whether you are trying to stay cancer free or currently have cancer. The principles of diet are the same, with some important caveats.\
\
If you don’t have a current cancer diagnosis, that is you have had cancer and are now in remission, it may be beneficial to lose weight if you are overweight. A normal BMI and weight loss are both associated with less relapse.\
\
If you currently have a cancer diagnosis weight loss can be a problem and although a low carbohydrate diet and intermittent fasting may be beneficial it’s very important to have sufficient calories to maintain your weight. Weight loss can be a problem in stage 4 cancer and is associated with poorer outcomes. This is why it is best to undertake any dietary modifications supervised by a nutritionist or dietitian if possible.

**Diets **associated with better outcomes are low in refined carbohydrates, processed and refined foods and are high in vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds, legumes and other whole foods. It is not necessary to be vegan or even vegetarian, although a diet that is predominantly plant food is best. This provides great nutrition, boosting our immune system and reducing inflammation.\
\
I believe we need to make quite **radical changes **to our diet and fall in love with food again. In our fast paced society we have resorted to a lot of refined and processed foods, snacking frequently (often on high carb and/or junk foods) and eating takeaways.

****

**The industrialisation of foods** has resulted in food that  is high in refined carbohydrates and sugars, which along with constant eating lead to high insulin levels. Insulin and its buddy insulin like growth factor are drivers of cell proliferation. When insulin levels fall low cells are able to rest and repair meaning damaged or faulty cells are removed from our bodies, heading off cancer in the very early stages. What's more the industrialisation of food has seen highly refined fats with a long shelf life enter our diets in high levels. These fats tend to be inflammatory and damaging and are drivers of cancer. On the other hand naturally occurring fats found in fruit (such as olives and avocados) and fish are anti-inflammatory and protective and we need to incorporate more of these in our diets.

****

**Another vital part of diet is the microbiome_ _**(the bacteria in our gut) which I will discuss separately in another blog. Gut bacteria feed on fiber so again a diet rich in a diverse array of plant foods and the addition of fermented foods which contains lots of 'good' bacteria is important for a healthy gut and a healthy gut is associated with better outcomes. Sugar, sweeteners, alcohol and some medicines have a negative impact on our gut bacteria.

****

**Intermittent fasting** and fasting overnight have great potential to improve outcomes and reduce symptoms from chemotherapy. It certainly has the ability to stimulate the body into a catabolic state (resting rather than proliferating), this is when faulty cells such as cancer cells are either repaired or removed. Fasting for 12 or more hours overnight helps the body do this every night, it also helps you develop healthy gut bacteria, also associated with better cancer outcomes. Mouse studies have shown that cancers grow more slowly in these conditions and become more vulnerable to chemotherapy. Likewise when healthy cells are in a rest and repair state they are less vulnerable to damage by chemotherapy, cancer cells never rest so remain vulnerable. However we have no evidence yet  as to how this might impact on human survival in cancer and no protocols to follow. As I said before it important that patients with a normal or low BMI don’t lose weight with stage 4 cancer and adequate nutrition is vital.



There are studies now showing that organic foods have an association with lower cancer rates. As well as being free of pesticides they are often covered in naturally occurring bacteria and fungi that may contribute to a healthy microbiome.

****

**So in summary** my advice about food is to eat at meal times, wholefoods, mainly plants and organic where possible. Drink lots of water, avoid snacking and sugary or artificially sweetened drinks and cut out refined sugar. Eat around the table with family or friends whenever possible. Try to always be mindful of your eating (not eating while watching TV, looking at your phone or working!). Sometimes have a break from eating altogether and have a break from eating overnight of at least 12 hours.

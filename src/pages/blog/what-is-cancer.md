Cancer is a disease which has the common condition of a cell that has lost its ability to control its own growth. It divides in an uncontrolled way forming a mass of cells called a tumour and can invade blood vessels and lymphatics to spread to other parts of the body. If the conditions are right the cells can form new tumour (called metastases or secondaries) in those body parts. What type of cancer someone has is defined by the cell type that the cancer started in. As the cells from that tissue grow and spread all the secondary tumours are like the original tissue the cancer started in. For example if a cell in the breast develops a tumour and spreads to the liver, the tumours that grow in the liver resemble breast tissue.



Cancers vary enormously depending on the tissue type the cancerous cells started in, how aggressively those cells grow and easily they can spread and start growing in other tissues. This is why no two cancers are the same.



When cancer tissue is viewed under the microscope a pathologist can apply different stains which help identify the type of tissue the cancer cell started in. They can also see how many cells are dividing and this gives the cancer a grade. The more cells that are dividing at one time the higher the grade. The higher the grade the more aggressive a cancer is. Most cancers are graded from 1 to 3.



Cancers are also staged. By looking at the tumour size (T) the local lymph nodes that have cancer cells in them (N) and if the cancer has spread beyond its tissue of origin and the ‘local” lymph nodes (M). The T N and M are put together to give a stage. Very generally speaking tumors that have no lymph nodes involved are stage 1 or 2, if the lymph nodes are involved but the cancer hasn’t spread further they might be stage 2 or 3 and if they have spread further afield they are likely stage 4. Staging is important as it helps predict how likely a cancer is to be cured by treatment. If a cancer is stage 1 or 2 or even 3 it can often be cut out leaving no visible cancer behind. If no cancer cells are left behind then a patient is cured. However if there are cancer cells left behind, either in the surrounding tissue or if they have spread further afield, then those cells can grow in to new tumours called secondaries. If this happens this is usually stage 4 cancer and is not usually cured, although things are changing with better surgeries and new drug therapies (blood and lymph cancers do not come into this category). Radiation given after surgery can eradicate these cells left behind and increase the chance of being cured. Likewise cells that may have drifted to other parts of the body can be eradicated with chemotherapy also increasing the chance of cure. This is called adjuvant treatment.



Unfortunately once secondary cancer cells have started growing into tumours chemotherapy and radiation is rarely curative. This is stage 4 cancer and until recently most treatments were aimed at controlling stage 4 cancer for as long as possible. Controlled cancer is usually far less debilitating than uncontrolled cancer and patients usually have a better quality of life if cancer can be brought under control. Chemotherapy used in this way is called palliative chemotherapy and is usually used at a lower dose or often by itself (rather than in combination with other chemotherapy drugs) so has less side effects than if used to try and cure people. 



Recently new drugs have been developed which work differently to chemotherapy. There are 2 new classes of drugs in particular. One group are called targeted therapies and the other is called Immunotherapy. These both have very different types of side effects to chemotherapy. I will talk about these in my next blog.

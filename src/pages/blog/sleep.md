# A Brief Introduction To Sleep

I have known Lisa for many years, since we sat our physician exams together way back when were were training in Waikato, as most of you will know going through mutual trauma can often forge strong friendships, so when I saw that Lisa was starting this excellent blog and podcast with lifestyle advice to assist people with cancer I got in touch.\\
Everybody sleeps. Because of this once you have a sleep problem inevitably every man and his dog will chip in with an opinion. There is a lot of very good advice out there but unfortunately also a lot of garbage, often aimed at selling you things. One of my aims in life is to be one of the useful people..... but I do have some very nice snake oil and for the right price .....

Sleep is a universal phenomenon amongst animals. We all sleep but how and why still remains to be completely understood, There is an enormous amount known about sleep but the further we delve into the science the more interesting and surprising questions emerge. This sense of exploration when dealing with something seemingly so mundane and common is a big reason why so many sleep researchers enjoy their job. It is certainly why I get engrossed!

# NORMAL SLEEP

So, firstly, before we talk about sleep problems, it is always useful to talk about “normal sleep” and whether society’s perceptions match the science. Unfortunately the belief, strongly held by some, that a normal sleep is a blissful state of restful slumber coming on immediately and lasting for eight uninterrupted hours culminating in you slowly and calmly waking up feeling refreshed and ready for the day ...... is nonsense.

The “normal” sleep duration is actually very variable and is said to be around 4.5 to 8.5 hours with most people being somewhere around 7.5 hours. Interestingly people at either extreme of the range of sleep duration have a higher incidence of dementia. Both Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher used to boast about how they needed very little sleep.

Sleep is not an instantaneous phenomenon either, you can’t just switch your brain off on demand. Taking 20 to 30 minutes to get to sleep is in fact normal, getting to sleep immediately can actually be a sign of sleep disturbance. 

Humans, being a pack animal, sleep cyclically, meaning they go from a superficial sleep to a deep sleep and then back to a more superficial state of sleep many times a night. As such there are many times that you can be woken up overnight and can feel a little anxious when this occurs. This happens because you are supposed to do this, to hear predators approaching and be able to alert the others in your group to the dangers. Being woken up by the cat coming in to the room is actually a pretty useful reflex as it probably meant that your distant ancestors didn’t get eaten by the sabre tooth tiger coming in to the cave! We cycle from a superficial sleep where our brain is quite active down to a deep sleep that is hard to wake from called “slow wave sleep” where our brains aren’t doing much, then on to Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep. REM is more or less our dream sleep where our brains are very active but quite unawares of surrounding things. Many people struggle at night and worry about waking up before morning. Because of the cyclical nature of sleep it is entirely normal to wake up once or twice a night.

The human brain runs vey fast and uses a huge amount of energy. All this energy being burnt produces a lot of debris but our brains run too fast to clear all this debris during the day so we think that the slow wave sleep, where the brain is very inactive, allows our cells to do the housekeeping and to clear out all the debris and waste products that build up during the day. REM sleep, we think, is for checking connections and managing memories in some way. I heard someone describe these two different types of sleep as “hardware sleep” and “software sleep” and it isn’t a bad analogy. When you lack the deep slow wave sleep you can feel lethargic and unrested. A lack of REM (dream) sleep is said to result in cognitive, thinking, problems, people often describe a vagueness or fuzziness in the mornings for a while. Experiencing these symptoms is not unusual in those with perfectly normal sleep but if they are worsening and becoming intrusive it may suggest an issue is developing.

Snoring and stopping breathing  are two other problems that people worry about. About 30% of people snore and we all stop breathing at night at times, we say 5 pauses or reductions in breathing an hour is actually the upper limit of normal. It is when people are waking up choking, are snorers and have excessive daytime sleepiness that we get worried in the sleep clinic.

So in summary, the spectrum of normal is very broad for sleep. I have had people come to me and say they have “terrible sleep because I take twenty minutes to get to sleep every night, I wake up twice and take twenty minutes each time to get back to sleep,I snore and my partner has seen me stop breathing once or twice, and then I wake up after only six hours of sleep”, all of which was within the normal range. Before worrying about sleep it is useful to know what is normal.

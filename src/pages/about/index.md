**What can I do? **This is the most common question as am I asked by someone facing a cancer journey. This inspired a booklet I wrote called "What can I do?' to help patients change their lifestyle to maximize their chance of a good outcome. The website will be an expanded resource helping you  to help yourself and the ones you love.

I wrote this short book in response to the rising tide of opposition to conventional medicine, sensible health and simple spirituality. There are so many opposing ideas around, claiming miracle cures and great health, that no one seems to know who to trust or turn to any more. People are spending vast amounts of money, time and energy on the pursuit of feeling good.

Today we have new epidemics of depression, anxiety, insomnia, headaches and fatigue. In the past the pace of life was slower â€“ no cars, no TV, no computers, less stress, and minimal refined and processed foods. People walked, talked and lived in extended families, ate unrefined foods, and spirituality was a vital part of their lives. Today we grossly abuse our bodies through eating the wrong foods and neglecting to exercise, suffer incredible emotional stress, live independent, lonely lives, and are indoctrinated with every imaginable worldly principle. Many people have lost their basic values and beliefs, even in the church. They seek to serve only themselves and have forgotten to fear God and show mercy to the oppressed, poor and sick.

Instead of attending to these problems, we are looking for magic cures to make it all better. The aim of this booklet is to help restore balance in our lives by teaching the basics of healthy eating, exercise, soul care and simple spiritual truths as taught in the Bible. By making these simple, though maybe radical lifestyle changes, we can achieve good health at no cost.

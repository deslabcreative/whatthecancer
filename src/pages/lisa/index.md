Hi I’m Lisa Dawson, I’m a medical Oncologist and lifestyle medicine advocate.




If you have been diagnosed with cancer, had cancer or are frightened of
getting cancer you may have headed to the internet to get some good advice and
been bombarded with mixed messages; hype, conspiracy theory, fake news and
slick truth that isn’t truth at all. You feel more confused than ever and have
no idea to trust. This drives me crazy as a cancer doctor, a mum and a patient
advocate. Just when you need someone to guide you on this journey called
cancer you feel more confused than ever.




I’ve been a cancer doctor for 10 years. Prior to that I was a family doctor
for 10 years. During that time I had 6 children one with a life threatening
heart condition we continue to live with. I know what it is like to be busy
and I know what it is like to be scared and wanting to do your absolute best
to survive. 


As a GP I became a passionate advocate of lifestyle medicine and wrote had a
book on holistic health published in 2005. I had the privilege of speaking to
people on the topic of wellness and health, at that time relating to
depression in particular. My study at the time led me to believe in the
irrefutable truth that lifestyle is medicine. Since I have become an
Oncologist I have discovered this is just as true for cancer as other chronic
medical conditions. There are things we can do with diet, exercise, self care
and sleep that can dramatically reduce our risk of cancer and if you already
have incurable cancer help you live well for longer (or even be cured).




During my time treating cancer patients I have come to deeply respect my
profession. The drugs we use in cancer treatment can work and can cure. Newer
drugs come with less side effects, are more effective and we have better drugs
for managing side effects. Drug companies have made it possible to invest
large amounts of money in to research and development. There have been
questionable ethics around the behaviour of drugs companies, especially around
sales and marketing but the drugs themselves used as intended are an important
weapon in the battle against cancer.. Combining our knowledge of drugs and
lifestyle therapy it is possible to get the best treatment and prevention
plan.




Over the years I have helped many of my patients make choices right for them.
I want to make what I have leaned available for everybody. I have created a
guide on 'What YOU can do’ to help yourself which you can download for free.
This is the same guide I give to my patients. In upcoming blogs and podcasts I
will explain the information in that booklet to you in more detail. I have
some great people lined up to interview on my podcasts, some inspiring
patients stories, great advice on implementing the suggestions and some video
series helping you understand the basics of cancer.




Avoid 'drowning', instead take control knowing you will have the best and
latest research at your fingertips. It’s been a privilege to journey with my
patients and I look forward to sharing the same journey with you.

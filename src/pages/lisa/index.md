Hi I’m Lisa Dawson, I’m a medical Oncologist and lifestyle medicine advocate.

I was born in the UK the eldest of 4 children, 3 of us now doctors and all passionate about lifestyle medicine.

I trained to be a doctor at St. Georges Medical School in London but shortly after qualifying I met my kiwi husband while sailing in Greece. After we married in England we moved to New Zealand. I initially trained as a GP and during this time I had 6 children. I also became increasingly convinced that as a family doctor I needed to help my patients help themselves by changing their lifestyles to prevent or reverse illness. I wrote a short book on holistic health and enjoyed speaking at conferences, events and on the radio about how to live a healthier, happier life. 

My oldest child George was born in 1999. Shortly after birth he turned blue and we found out he had a serious heart condition. He had heart surgery at 5 days old, 3 months old and more recently at 15. It's been a difficult journey and has made me all the more passionate about my role as a doctor. I believe empowering and equipping people to understand and be confident to manage their own health is a vital role we play as doctors.

In 2008 I changed direction as a doctor and re trained as an Oncologist or a Cancer specialist. After 6 years of training I accepted a job as the first Medical Oncologist in Northland and set up a new Cancer department. Over 3 years I was joined by several colleagues and led our department on to win an award for an outstanding model of care. 

During the last 5 years I have discovered more than ever the importance of empowering and equipping patients to navigate their own cancer journey. Understanding is the first step in taking charge of our own health. Making lifestyle changes is crucial to staying well for as long as possible.

I have endeavored to learn as much as I can about lifestyle medicine and feel passionately that looking for the root cause of disease and helping people change or eliminate these root causes through a change in lifestyle is the future of good medicine. Recently I joined the faculty of Prekure - a social enterprise that exists to inspire a change in medicine to be more focused on prevention. I have also joined the Society of Integrative Oncology whose mission reflects mine - to advance evidence-based, comprehensive, integrative healthcare to improve the lives of people affected by cancer.

I hope to share what I have learned and what I continue to learn with you on this website.

When I'm not working-  I'm running around after or with my husband, children and German Shepherd Molly. Whenever we can we get out on the water sailing.
